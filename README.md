Each paragraph begins on a new line. Simply press <return> for a new line.
 
For example, 
like this.
 
You'll need an empty line between a paragraph and any following markdown construct, 
such as an ordered or unordered list, for that to be rendered. Like this:
 
* Item 1
* Item 2

*Italic characters*
_Italic characters_
**bold characters**
__bold characters__
~~strikethrough text~~

> Neque porro quisquam est qui
> dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet,
> consectetur, adipisci velit...

```
This is a code block
```

```javascript
var oldUnload = window.onbeforeunload;
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    saveCoverage();
    if (oldUnload) {
        return oldUnload.apply(this, arguments);
    }
};
```
