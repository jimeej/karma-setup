Karma provides helpful tools that make it easier to us to call our Jasmine tests whilst we are writing code.
(What’s –save-dev? That’s an option that updates the installed packages in the ‘devDependencies’ section of the package.json file. It signifies that a developer will need this package to work with the application, but it’s not required to run the applicaiton i.e. in production.)


Function coverage – Has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?
Statement coverage – Has each statement in the program been executed?
Branch coverage – Has each branch (also called DD-path) of each control structure (such as in if and case statements) been executed? For example, given an if statement, have both the true and false branches been executed? Another way of saying this is, has every edge in the program been executed?
Condition coverage (or predicate coverage) – Has each Boolean sub-expression evaluated both to true and false?
